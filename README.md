# Roller

Roller is a DMX lighting control app


## Goals
- Fully controllable via MIDI controller interface - no screen required
- Intended for use in small-medium sized, DJ-centric setups
- Performance centric
    - As few hard-coded values as possible
    - Effects should be composable
    - Speed/Intensity as parameters, so one set of effects can work from chill house music up to searing gabber


## Architecture (WIP)
### DMX/Ola Output
### Projects, Fixtures, Fixture Profiles
### MIDI Control
### Clock
### Effects
### Lighting Engine
